# PyData Dagster + Noteable demo workshop

This example project will be used at PyData for the Dagster and Noteable workshop.

The top level folder (`tutorial_notebook_assets`) contains two separate Dagster projects. `tutorial_finished` contains the completed version of the demo and can be used for reference during the workshop. `tutorial_template` contains a skeleton project that we will complete during the workshop. At the end of the session `tutorial_template` should be a duplicate of `tutorial_finished`.
